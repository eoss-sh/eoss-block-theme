# First Draft

_**The first draft of your next block theme for WordPress.**_

First Draft is meant to be a starting point for building block themes and an educational tool. Its audience is a mixed bag, ranging from people are just now dipping their toes into theme creation to those who are highly-knowledgeable developers. Decisions about its architecture tries to account for this full spectrum while following best practices.

One of the primary goals of the project is to be a showcase of WordPress' modern theming features. This includes everything from patterns, to block style variations, to block-based templates.

The theme attempts to be reasonably bare-bones in terms of style, leaving the bells and whistles up to you. At the same time, it is also highly opinionated on certain matters, such as naming schemes.

First Draft was built to be forked so that you can do things your own way.

## FAQs

### Why no build process?

The theme aims to very much be "plug-n-play" for anyone at any skill level. Additional technical hurdles can be the difference between someone learning theme design for the first time or giving up before they even get to the fun part of it. Besides, if you are advanced enough to set up build tools, it should be easy to insert your preferred system into your fork of First Draft.
